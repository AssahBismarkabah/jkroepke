### Cloud Sucess Manager @ [adorsys](https://www.adorsys.de)

Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a cloud system engineer and help our and customer developer to understand how be responsable for production. I create tools that help our developers to release the applications to production!

Let's automate it!

## OSS developer time

In my free time I'm going to support and maintain opensource project. My personal developer skill are gone but google help me a lot to understand languages like Java and JavaScript.

### Some of my projects:

#### https://github.com/jkroepke/2Moons

A Browergame engine from my first coding days!

#### https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets

I love the deployment via helm. The original helm-secrets project was discontinued. I started a fork and I learn how bash unit tests work!

#### https://github.com/jkroepke/openshift-mta

On my customer projects I need a RHEL supported MTA which runs in openshift without touch the scc policies. I learn a lot about m4 and the old sendmail.

#### https://github.com/jkroepke/puppet-module-autofs

My first puppet module released on puppet forged. It based on a other discontinued project.

#### https://github.com/jkroepke/github_exporter

I love Prometheus to hold statistics. I wrote the tool @ adorsys to track all statistica from the organisation project to gain a org wide overview about all repositories in one dashboard. I used the GraphQL API from GitHub to reduce the amount of REST calls to a minimum.

#### https://github.com/adorsys/keycloak-config-cli

I wrote this tool with @borisskert at adorsys. Initially we need a config as code tool for our keycloak instance to automate the configuration tasks. Click on the UI was a nogo. After the first PoC with bash and curl scripting we rewrote the whool tool in java and used the Rest client provided by keycloak.
